At the solution of the QP the function approximations have the values

$\tilde \f^{k\star} = -4.464811e-01$

$\tilde \g^{k\star} =  9.505003e-08$

\bigskip
while the actual functions are evaluated to be

$\f^{k\star} = -5.158540e-01$

$\g^{k\star} = -2.278227e-02$

\bigskip
 The solution leads to a feasible descent step and                     is therefore deemed \emph{acceptable}, as is. 
 
(In this case both approximations are indeed conservative,                         nevertheless.)
