At the solution of the QP the function approximations have the values

$\tilde \f^{k\star} = -4.621899e-01$

$\tilde \g^{k\star} =  6.450742e-07$

\bigskip
while the actual functions are evaluated to be

$\f^{k\star} = -5.619993e-01$

$\g^{k\star} =  2.613989e-02$

\bigskip
 However, the solution (step)                     is deemed \emph{unacceptable}, because 
 


 $\to$ the value of the constraint function                         approximation is less than the actual function value, at                         the new design point, $\tilde {\g}^{k\star} < {\g}^{k\star}$.

 \bigskip 

 That is, at least one approximation                     function is not \emph{conservative}.
