At the solution of the QP the function approximations have the values

$\tilde \f^{k\star} = -4.622e-01$

$\tilde \g^{k\star} = -3.387e-12$

\bigskip
while the actual functions are evaluated to be

$\f^{k\star} = -5.620e-01$

$\g^{k\star} =  2.614e-02$

\bigskip
 However, the solution (step)                         is not a feasible descent step, and it is deemed                         \emph{unacceptable}, because 
 


 $\to$ the value of the constraint function                             approximation is less than the actual function value, at                             the new design point, $\tilde {\g}^{k\star} < {\g}^{k\star}$.

 \bigskip 

 That is, at least one approximation                         function is not \emph{conservative}.
