 The solution leads to a feasible descent step and                     is therefore deemed \emph{acceptable}, as is.

 Both the value objective function approximation                     and the constraint function approximation, at the new design point                     $x^{k\star}$, is \emph{conservative} with respect to the actual function                     values, $\tilde {\f}^{k\star} > {\f}^{k\star}$,                     $\tilde {\g}^{k\star} > {\g}^{k\star}$
