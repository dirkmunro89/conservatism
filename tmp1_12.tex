At the solution of the QP the function approximations have the values

$\tilde \f^{k\star} = -5.410e-01$

$\tilde \g^{k\star} = -3.338e-10$

\bigskip
while the actual functions are evaluated to be

$\f^{k\star} = -5.410e-01$

$\g^{k\star} = -1.709e-08$

\bigskip
 The solution leads to a feasible descent step and                     is therefore deemed \emph{acceptable}, as is. 
 
(Note that the objective and/or constraint function approximation                         is not conservative, in this case.)
