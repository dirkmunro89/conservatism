At the solution of the QP the function approximations have the values

$\tilde \f^{k\star} = -5.429334e-01$

$\tilde \g^{k\star} = -5.001063e-05$

\bigskip
while the actual functions are evaluated to be

$\f^{k\star} = -5.414386e-01$

$\g^{k\star} =  4.267925e-04$

\bigskip
 However, the solution (step)                     is deemed \emph{unacceptable}, because 
 
$\to$ the value of the objective                         function approximation is less than the actual function                         value, at the new design point,                         $\tilde {\f}^{k\star} < {\f}^{k\star}$.

 \bigskip 

 That is, at least one approximation                     function is not \emph{conservative}.
